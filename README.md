For me

CSS Style
    - We can declare global css such as theme colors, font on global.css and import it on import zone on file
    - We can create class of css and then import and use it as a object as home.module.css and we i use it on page.tsx
    - 'clsx' it is lib that use to conditional toggle css style or classname
    - on tailwind css if we use class like this classname="hidden md:block" => it mean on device is medium or larger breakpoint it will be show block but when screen is less than md that will be hidden

Font and Images
    - next/font it will download font on building that mean it will be static font
    - next/image we should to set width and height to avoid shift on different screen
